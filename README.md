# My projects outside of Github

Since many repositories are moving to other services and not all of my work is open source, I'd like to list references to other websites showing my programming or code-related work. This would've been a gist if gists were properly visible.

## Crypto

[On the Monero project's self-hosted GitLab](https://repo.getmonero.org/ProkhorZ): in 2018-2019, I translated user guides to Dutch for the [Monero website](https://web.getmonero.org/). I also discussed issues and corrected a few errors.

For the Kovri project [on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/ProkhorZ): in 2018-2019, I translated documentation and the Kovri website to Dutch. The translation has been merged, but it's not been published on the website, since the Kovri project was more or less cancelled after releasing an alpha version. I also corrected a few errors.

## Webdev

In 2019, I created [Blockchain Translator](http://blockchain-translator.com/), a profile website for myself as a freelancer, built in Bootstrap using [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/)'s Modern Business template. I like Bootstrap and I'm using it offline to create more websites.
